# Web of Needs
Structurally, the Web resembles a marketplace: Web clients download documents from servers just like customers buy goods from kiosks. Interestingly, the marketplace metaphor for the Web goes further: most Web users are in the role of the customer and the documents downloaded in most cases actually represent commercial offers. This second resemblance leads to a fundamental asymmetry: in general, commercial offers are represented as first-class objects on the Web. Consumer needs, however, the very notions that drive the interaction, only materialize in the form of search terms or browsing behaviour. In this paper, we present an approach for explicitly representing needs as first-class objects on the Web of data in a way that allows interacting with them.

## Development
The code available on our github repository is a prototype implementation of all required components for the Web of Needs:
* Owner,
* Node and
* Matcher.

The 'master' branch should contain stable code. Go to the 'devel' branch for up-to-date, but possibly unstable code.

You can try our [spartanic demo](http://ec2-176-34-213-201.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/owner/) or download the "WTF app" from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.desideratum) that uses the web
